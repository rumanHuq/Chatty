# CHATTY

I always have a softspot for niche tech. This docker workspace / monorepo provides some really bleeding edge tech enabling gRPC for client/server communication
It includes:

 - Rust tonic as backend service
 - envoy for transforming http/1.1 to http/2 aka gRPC calls
 - svelte for frontend service
 - svelte nativescript for mobile app service (TODO)
